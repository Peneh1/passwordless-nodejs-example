 * Register - Get token from the passwordless API
 * 
 * The passwordless client side code needs a Token to register a key to a username.
 * The token is used by the Passwordless API to verify that this action is allowed for this user.
 * Your server can create this token by calling the Passwordless API with the ApiSecret.
 * This allows you to control the process, perhaps you only want to allow new users to register or only allow already signed in users to add a Key to their own account.
 * 
 * Request body looks like:
 * { username: 'anders', displayName:'Anders Ã…berg'}
 * Response body looks like:
 * "abcdefghiojklmnopq..."
